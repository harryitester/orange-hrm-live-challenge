# Getting Start
1. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
2. [Execute test parallel](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel)
3. [HTML Report](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters)
4. [Allure Report](https://testersdock.com/allure-playwright/)
5. [Page Object Model](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom)
6. [Cross Environment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env)

# Installation
The following softwares are required:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [JDK 19](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/install/overview-jdk-installation.html)


# Set up

    `npx playwright install msedge`


4. If "cross-env" cannot be found on your machine, execute below command to install globaly

`npm install -g cross-env`

- Running with specific environment, country by passing the process environments (using country to get the correct localization to navigate or url)

// environment = [test, production(don't have infor), prerelease(don't have infor)]
// scriptFilePath = copy relative path of the test spec file

cross-env test_env=${envionment} npx playwright test ${scriptFilePath}


- Running with specific grep
@login
@search
@sanity
@regression
cross-env test_env=${envionment} npx playwright test ${scriptFilePath} --grep ${grep}


To run all test on local:
    `npm test`


To Run Only Login Tests:
    `npm run test:login`



Run with a Tag (e.g., @new):
    `npx cross-env TEST_ENV=production npx playwright test --grep @new`



To Run with a Specific Environment:
    `npx cross-env TEST_ENV=production npm run test:login`
    `npx cross-env TEST_ENV=test npm run test:login`



To Run with a Specific browser such as `chrome`:
    `cross-env TEST_ENV=test playwright test tests/search/search-menu.spec.ts --project=chromium`

Open the Allure Report
    `npx allure open ./allure-report`
This will open the Allure report in your default browser.
