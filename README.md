// scriptFilePath = copy relative path of the test spec file

cross-env test_env=${envionment} npx playwright test ${scriptFilePath}


- Running with specific grep
@login
@search
@sanity
@regression
cross-env test_env=${envionment} npx playwright test ${scriptFilePath} --grep ${grep}


To run all test on local:
    `npm test`


To Run Only Login Tests:
    `npm run test:login`



Run with a Tag (e.g., @new):
    `npx cross-env TEST_ENV=production npx playwright test --grep @new`



To Run with a Specific Environment:
